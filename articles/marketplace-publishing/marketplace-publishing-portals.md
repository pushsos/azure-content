# Portals you will need
Before you start with the process, letâ€™s get you introduced to the various portals that you will need to get offer the published. Below is the short summary about the Portals - **Seller Dashboard, Publishing Portal** and **Azure Preview Portal** in the order you will interact with them.                                                                            
## Seller Dashboard
[https://sellerdashboard.microsoft.com](https://sellerdashboard.microsoft.com)
### Description
Creating your Seller Dashboard account is a one-time task. The partner should check to make sure the company does not already have a Seller Dashboard account before attempting to create one. During the process, we collect bank account information, tax information, and company address information.

> [AZURE.NOTE] If you are publishing only free offers (or bring-your-own-license) we do not require tax and bank information.

### Identity/Account Used
Ideally a Distribution List or a Security Group (e.g. azurepublishing@partnercompany.com). This Distribution List or a Security Group **MUST** be registered as a Microsoft Account.

> [AZURE.TIP] We recommend using a Distribution List or a Security Group as it removes the dependency on any individual; although an individual account be used as well.

## Publishing Portal
[https://publish.windowsazure.com](https://publish.windowsazure.com)

### Description
Portal for the partner to work on their offer and to publish it (marketing, pricing, publishing, certification if applicable, etc.).

### Identity/Account Used
Above **Distribution List** or a **Security Group** must be used for the first time to login on Publishing portal and later other users can be added as co-admin. This is how it gets mapped to the Seller Dashboard registration data.

## Azure Preview Portal
[https://ms.portal.azure.com](https://ms.portal.azure.com)
### Description
This is the portal where the partners can view their Staged and Published offers in the Marketplace (applicable for VMs, solution templates and ARM-based Developer Services)
### Identity/Account Used
While staging the offer from publishing portal a subscription ID needs to be whitelisted. The same subscription[there is a username and password associated] needs to be used while logging in to this portal to test the staged offer.

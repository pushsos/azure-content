# How to publish an offer to the Microsoft Azure Marketplace
This article is provided to help a seller create and deploy his/her solution e.g. single virtual machine image, solution template, developer service, or data service to the Azure Marketplace for other Azure customers and partners to purchase and utilize.

The first thing you would want to do as a publisher is to define what kind of solution your company is offering. Azure Marketplace supports multiple different types of solutions and each of them require a slightly different set of work from you in order to successfully publish into the Marketplace.

**Types of solutions:**

- Data Services
- Developer Services
- Virtual Machines
- Solution Templates

Some steps are shared between the different types of solutions. This provides a short overview of what steps you will need to complete for any type of solution.

**Before you begin any work on the Azure Marketplace, you must be pre-approved. Not applicable for data service publishers.**

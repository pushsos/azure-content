# Understanding your Seller Insights Reports

**What are Seller Insights?**

All VM and usage-based billing developer services publishers will receive monthly reports from Microsoft, if your offers are generating usage.

**What will I receive?**

- **Welcome Email:** As a new publisher, you will receive a welcome email to notify you that will you will begin receiving the seller insights monthly reports.

- **Monthly Sales Reports:**  If you have usage, you will receive a second email attaching your reports and instructions on how to access your password

    - If you have a VM or Usage-based Billing Developer Services SKU generating usage, your monthly report will show you details about the orders, usage, markets, and customer details for your non-BYOL offers;
    - These files are locked with a password only you and Microsoft know in order to protect your customers’ data.
    - We will NOT send a report if none of your offers have not generated usage during the month.

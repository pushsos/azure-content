# Setting up Azure PowerShell to create an offer for the Azure Marketplace
For detailed information on how to set up PowerShell in Azure, visit [How to Install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md). A simple approach is to use the certificate method, which downloads and imports a certificate needed to authenticate. To obtain the needed certificate, use the *Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile* cmdlet. Save the file once prompted. To import the certificate into a PowerShell session, use the *Import-AzurePublishSettingsFile*.

To configure and store the common Microsoft Azure subscription settings for the PowerShell session, use the *Set-AzureSubscription* and *Select-AzureSubscription* cmdlets:

        Set-AzureSubscription -SubscriptionName “mySubName” -CurrentStorageAccountName “mystorageaccount”
        Select-AzureSubscription -SubscriptionName "mySubName" –Current

The first command associates a default storage account with the subscription (needed for some VM provisioning operations).  The second makes the subscription the current one (recognized by other cmdlets).

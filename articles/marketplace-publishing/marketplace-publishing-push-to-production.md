# Deploying your offer to the Azure Marketplace
When you are satisfied with your offer e.g. tested customer scenarios, marketing content, etc. and you are ready to launch, request **Push to Production** in the **Publish** tab.  

1.	These 4 steps on the Walkthrough page should be completed and green.

3. Upon selection of this option, the below page will be displayed. Click on the option **Request approval to push to production**. Once the request is made, the approval team executes a final review and then your offer will be made publically available in the  Marketplace. The status of the offer will be changed to **"Listed"**.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] You can always delete the offer while it is in a **"draft"** status (i.e. never **push to staging**, **push to production**). In the **History** tab, click **Discard draft** button at the bottom of the page to delete a draft.

> For **Virtual Machine Images,** the replication across the data centers takes up to 24-48hours. Once the replication is complete, your offer will be listed in the [Azure Marketplace](http://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace).

## Next steps
Once the offer goes live, test the customer scenarios to validate all the contracts and functionality work properly in the production environment as tested and validated in the staging environment.

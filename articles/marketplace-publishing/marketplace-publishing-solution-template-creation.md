# Guide to create a Solution Template for Azure Marketplace
After completing the step 1, [Account Creation and Registration][link-acct-creation], we guided you on the creation of an Azure compatible Solution Template under the [Technical Pre-requisites for creating a Solution Template](marketplace-publishing-solution-template-creation-prerequisites.md). Now we will walk you through the steps for creating a multi-VM Solution Template on the [Publishing Portal][link-pubportal] for the Azure Marketplace.

## Create your Solution Template offer in the Publishing Portal
Go to the [https://publish.windowsazure.com](http://publish.windowsazure.com). **For first time login to [Publishing Portal](https://publish.windowsazure.com/), use the same account with which your company’s Seller Profile was registered.** Later you can add any employee of your company as a co-admin in the Publishing Portal.

### 1. Select 'Solution Templates'

### 3. Start with Topologies
A solution template is a 'parent' to all of its topologies. You can define multiple topologies in one offer/solution template. When an offer is pushed to staging, it is pushed with all of its topologies. Given below are the steps to define your offer.     
- Create a Topology – **“Topology Identifier”** is typically the name of the Topology for the solution template. The Topology Identifier will be used in the URL as shown below:

  Azure Marketplace :
http://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/partners/{PublisherNamespace}/{OfferIdentifier}{TopologyIdentifier}

  Azure Preview Portal :
https://ms.portal.azure.com/#gallery/{PublisherNamespace}.{OfferIdentifier}{TopologyIdentifier}

- Add a new version  

### 4. Get your topology versions certified
Upload a zip file containing all required files to provision that particular version of the topology. This zip file must contain the following:
- *mainTemplate.json* and *createUiDefinition.json* file at its root
- Any linked templates and all required scripts.

After uploading the zip file, click on **Request Certification**. The Microsoft certification team will review the files and certify the topology.

> [AZURE.TIP] While your developers work on creating the Solution Template topologies and getting them certified, the Business/Marketing/Legal department of your company can work on the marketing and legal content.

## Next Steps
Now that you created your Solution Template and submitted the zip file with the required files for certification, you can can continue to and follow the instructions in [Marketplace Marketing Content Guide](marketplace-publishing-push-to-staging.md) before preparing your offer for testing in Staging.

# Test your VM offer for the Marketplace in staging

Staging means deploying your SKU in a private “sandbox” where you can test and validate its functionality before deploying it to the Marketplace. The SKU will appear in staging just as it would to a customer who has deployed it. Your VM image must be certified to be pushed to staging.

## Step 1: Push your offer to staging

1. Click **Push to Staging** in the **Publish** tab.

2. Correct any errors or discrepancies in which the Publishing Portal may notify you a this point.
3.	Provide the list of Azure subscriptions you will use to preview your offer in [Azure Preview portal](https://portal.azure.com) in the pop up box as shown in the screenshot above.
4. Login to the [Azure Preview Portal](http://portal.azure.com) using one of the above Azure subscriptions listed in the previous step.
5. Find your offer and validate your VM image points:
  1. Marketing content is showing up correctly in the gallery

  2. End-to-end deployment of VM image

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Your offer will remain in staging until you notify Microsoft via Publishing Portal [**Publish** > **"Request Approval to Push to Production"**] that you are ready to push to production. This is an ideal time to have all members of the team check over everything in preparation for your offer going live.

> The replication across the data centers take up to 24-48hours. Once the replication is complete, your offer will be listed in the [Azure Marketplace](http://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace).

## Next Steps
Now that you offer is "Staged", and you have tested it's functionality and marketing content , you can proceed to the final offer and/or SKU publishing phase, **Step 4**,  [Deploying your offer to the Marketplace](marketplace-publishing-push-to-production.md)

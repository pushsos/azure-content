# How to: Configure firewall settings on SQL Database


Microsoft Azure SQL Database uses firewall rules to allow connections to your servers and databases. You can define server-level and database-level firewall settings for the master or a user database in your Azure SQL Database server to selectively allow access to the database.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] To allow applications from Azure to connect to your database server, Azure connections must be enabled. For more information about firewall rules and enabling connections from Azure, see [Azure SQL Database Firewall](sql-database-firewall-configure.md). You may have to open some additional TCP ports if you are making connections inside the Azure cloud boundary. For more information, see the **V12 of SQL Database: Outside vs inside** section of [Ports beyond 1433 for ADO.NET 4.5 and SQL Database V12](sql-database-develop-direct-route-ports-adonet-v12.md)


## Server-level firewall rules

Server-level firewall rules can be created and managed through the Microsoft Azure Management Portal, Transact-SQL, Azure PowerShell, or REST API.

### Manage server-level firewall rules through the New Azure Portal


[AZURE.INCLUDE [sql-database-include-ip-address-22-v12portal](../../includes/sql-database-include-ip-address-22-v12portal.md)]


## Manage server-level firewall rules through Management Portal 

1. From the Management Portal, click **SQL Databases**. All databases and their corresponding servers are listed here.
2. Click **Servers** at the top of the page.
3. Click the arrow beside the server for which you want to manage firewall rules.
4. Click **Configure** at the top of the page.

	*  To add the current computer, click Add to the Allowed IP Addresses.
	*  To add additional IP addresses, type in the Rule Name, Start IP Address, and End IP Address.
	*  To modify an existing rule, click any of the fields in the rule and modify.
	*  To delete an existing rule, hover over the rule until the X appears at the end of the row. Click X to remove the rule.
5. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page to save the changes.

## Manage server-level firewall rules through Transact-SQL

1. Launch a query window through the Management Portal or through SQL Server Management Studio.
2. Verify you are connected to the master database.
3. Server-level firewall rules can be selected, created, updated, or deleted from within the query window.
4. To create or update server-level firewall rules, execute the sp_set_firewall rule stored procedure. The following example enables a range of IP addresses on the server Contoso.<br/>Start by seeing what rules already exist.

		SELECT * FROM sys.firewall_rules ORDER BY name;

	Next, add a firewall rule.

		EXECUTE sp_set_firewall_rule @name = N'ContosoFirewallRule',
			@start_ip_address = '192.168.1.1', @end_ip_address = '192.168.1.10'

	To delete a server-level firewall rule, execute the sp_delete_firewall_rule stored procedure. The following example deletes the rule named ContosoFirewallRule.
 
		EXECUTE sp_delete_firewall_rule @name = N'ContosoFirewallRule'
 
## Manage server-level firewall rules through Azure PowerShell
1. Launch Azure PowerShell.
2. Server-level firewall rules can be created, updated, and deleted using Azure PowerShell. 

	To create a new server-level firewall rule, execute the New-AzureSqlDatabaseServerFirewallRule cmdlet. The following example enables a range of IP addresses on the server Contoso.
 
		New-AzureSqlDatabaseServerFirewallRule –StartIPAddress 192.168.1.1 –EndIPAddress 192.168.1.10 –RuleName ContosoFirewallRule –ServerName Contoso
 
	To modify an existing server-level firewall rule, execute the Set-AzureSqlDatabaseServerFirewallRule cmdlet. The following example changes the range of acceptable IP addresses for the rule named ContosoFirewallRule.
 
		Set-AzureSqlDatabaseServerFirewallRule –StartIPAddress 192.168.1.4 –EndIPAddress 192.168.1.10 –RuleName ContosoFirewallRule –ServerName Contoso

	To delete an existing server-level firewall rule, execute the Remove-AzureSqlDatabaseServerFirewallRule cmdlet. The following example deletes the rule named ContosoFirewallRule.

		Remove-AzureSqlDatabaseServerFirewallRule –RuleName ContosoFirewallRule –ServerName Contoso
 
## Manage server-level firewall rules through REST API
1. Managing firewall rules through REST API must be authenticated. For information, see Authenticating Service Management Requests.
2. Server-level rules can be created, updated, or deleted using REST API

	To create or update a server-level firewall rule, execute the POST method using the following:
 
		https://management.core.windows.net:8443/{subscriptionId}/services/sqlservers/servers/Contoso/firewallrules
	
	Request Body

		<ServiceResource xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/windowsazure">
		  <Name>ContosoFirewallRule</Name>
		  <StartIPAddress>192.168.1.4</StartIPAddress>
		  <EndIPAddress>192.168.1.10</EndIPAddress>
		</ServiceResource>
 

	To remove an existing server-level firewall rule, execute the DELETE method using the following:
	 
		https://management.core.windows.net:8443/{subscriptionId}/services/sqlservers/servers/Contoso/firewallrules/ContosoFirewallRule
 
## Database-level firewall rules

1. After creating a server-level firewall for your IP address, launch a query window through the Management Portal or through SQL Server Management Studio.
2. Connect to the database for which you want to create a database-level firewall rule.

	To create a new or update an existing database-level firewall rule, execute the sp_set_database_firewall_rule stored procedure. The following example creates a new firewall rule named ContosoFirewallRule.
 
		EXEC sp_set_database_firewall_rule @name = N'ContosoFirewallRule', @start_ip_address = '192.168.1.11', @end_ip_address = '192.168.1.11'
 
	To delete an existing database-level firewall rule, execute the sp_delete_database_firewall_rule stored procedure. The following example deletes the rule named ContosoFirewallRule.
 
		EXEC sp_delete_database_firewall_rule @name = N'ContosoFirewallRule'

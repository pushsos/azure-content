SQL Database V12 is the latest version of SQL Database and it has [many advantages over the previous V2 version](sql-database-v12-whats-new.md). This article shows how to upgrade V2 servers to V12 using the Azure preview portal. 

During the process of upgrading to SQL Database V12 you must also [update all Web and Business databases to a new service tier](sql-database-upgrade-new-service-tiers.md). The following directions include the steps to update your Web and Business databases with pricing tier recommendations based on your database's historical usage. 



1. In the [Azure Preview Portal](http://portal.azure.com/) browse to the server you want to upgrade by selecting **BROWSE ALL** > **SQL servers**, and selecting the desired server.
2. Select **Latest SQL database update**, then select **Upgrade this server**.

## Upgrade your Web and Business databases

2. Upgrade all Web and Business databases. If your server has any Web or Business databases you must upgrade them. To assist you with upgrading, the SQL Database service recommends an appropriate service tier and performance level (pricing tier) for each database. By analyzing the historical usage for each database, the service recommends a tier that is best suited for running your existing databaseâ€™s workload. 
    
    Select each database to review and select the recommended pricing tier to upgrade to. You can always browse the available pricing tiers and select the one that suits your environment best.

7. After clicking the suggested tier you will be presented with the **Choose your ricing tier** blade where you can select a tier and then click the **Select** button to change to that tier. Select a new tier for each Web or Business database

After all databases on the server are eligible you are ready to start the upgrade

## Start the upgrade

3. When all the databases on the server are eligible for upgrade you need to **TYPE THE SERVER NAME** to verify that you want to perform the upgrade, and then click **OK**.

4. The upgrade starts and displays the in progress notification. The upgrade process is initiated. Depending on the details of your specific databases upgrading to V12 can take some time. During this time all databases on the server will remain online but server and database management actions will be restricted.

    At the time of the actual transition to the new performance level temporary dropping of the connections to the database can happen for a very small duration (typically measured in seconds). If an application has transient fault handling (retry logic) for connection terminations then it is sufficient to protect against dropped connections at the end of the upgrade. 

5. After the upgrade operation completes the SQL Database V12 server features are enabled.

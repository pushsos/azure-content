# Connecting your device to the Azure IoT Suite remote monitoring solution


## Scenario overview

In this example, we will have three simulated data sources:  external temperature, internal temperature and humidity. We are not using real sensors  for simplicity purposes (data is self-generated in the client code), but we encourage you as a next step to connect your favorite sensor and send real data. Please visit the resources linked on the Extending your solution section for more information.

## Prerequisites

### Provision your IoT Suite

If you haven't provisioned your remote monitoring preconfigured solution yet, you can provision it [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/internet-of-things/getting-started.aspx).


### Provision your device in the remote monitoring solution
```
Note: if you have already provisioned a device on your solution, you can skip this step.
```
To get your device connected to the preconfigured solution, you must get the device credentials from the dashboard. This will be used in your client application so that your device can be identified. Follow this steps

1.  On the lower left corner of the dashboard, click on "Add a device".

    ![][1]

2.  On Custom Device, click on the "Add new" button.

    ![][2]

3.  Choose your own Device ID by entering a name such as realdevice1, and click on Check ID to make sure that name hasn't been used yet.

    ![][3]

5. Please copy your credentials provided (Device ID, IoT Hub Hostname and Device Key). You will need them later in your client application to connect your device to the solution.

    ![][4]

6. Ensure your device is displayed correctly on the devices section. The status will be "Pending". This is expected until the device to cloud connection is established.

    ![][5]

[5]: ./media/iot-suite-connecting-devices/suite5new.png

Now choose which language would you like to use to continue your sample. In this tutorial, we've created sample code for C and node.js but you could also implement it in C Sharp and Java.

## Sending device data to the remote monitoring solution using C


### Running your device on Linux

1. Set up your environment: if you've never used our Device SDK before,  learn  how to set up your environment on Linux [here](https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/develop/c/doc/devbox_setup.md#linux).

1. Open the file **c/serializer/samples/serializer/remote_monitoring.c** in a text editor.

2. Locate the following code in the file:

    ```
    static const char* deviceId = "[Device Id]";
    static const char* deviceKey = "[Device Key]";
    static const char* hubName = "[IoTHub Name]";
    static const char* hubSuffix = "[IoTHub Suffix, i.e. azure-devices.net]";
    ```
    
3. Replace "[Device Id]", "[Device Key], with  your device data.

4. Use the IoT Hub Hostname device data to fill in IoTHub name and IoTHub Suffix. To do this, you need to split in IoTHub + IoTHubSuffix. For example: if your IoT Hub Hostname is "Contoso.azure-devices.net", "Contoso" will be your IoTHub name and the rest is the Suffix. It should look like this:

    ```
    static const char* deviceId = "mydevice";
    static const char* deviceKey = "mykey";
    static const char* hubName = "Contoso";
    static const char* hubSuffix = "azure-devices.net";
    ```

5. Save your changes and build the samples.  To build your sample you can run the the build.sh script in the **c/build_all/linux** directory.

6. Run the **c/serializer/samples/remote_monitoring/linux/remote_monitoring** sample application.

#### Visualize your registered device and the data

7. Go back to your remote monitoring solution dashboard. You should the device has changed the status to Running on the Devices list.

    ![][18]

8. Click on the dashboard to see data coming. The sample is configured to send 50 units for internal temperature, 55 units for external temperature and 50 for humidity. Please note that the dashboard only shows temperature and humidity by default.

8. Now go to the Command and control [section](#command) to learn how to change the temperature on your device from the remote monitoring solution.


### Running your device on Windows


1. Set up your environment: if you have never used our device SDK before, learn  how to set up your environment on Windows [here](https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/develop/c/doc/devbox_setup.md#windows).

1. Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2015. Open the **remote_monitoring.sln** solution in the **c\\serializer\\build\\windows** folder in your local copy of the repository.

2. In Visual Studio, in **Solution Explorer**, navigate to the samples folder. In the **remote_monitoring** project, open the **remote_monitoring.c** file.

2. Locate the following code in the file:

    ```
    static const char* deviceId = "[Device Id]";
    static const char* deviceKey = "[Device Key]";
    static const char* hubName = "[IoTHub Name]";
    static const char* hubSuffix = "[IoTHub Suffix, i.e. azure-devices.net]";
    ```

3. Replace "[Device Id]", "[Device Key], with the data your device data.

4. Use the IoT Hub Hostname device data to fill in IoTHub name and IoTHub Suffix. To do this, you need to split it in to like this:

    If your IoT Hub Hostname is Contoso.azure-devices.net, Contoso will be your IoTHub name and everything after it will the the Suffix. It should look like this:

    ```
    static const char* deviceId = "mydevice";
    static const char* deviceKey = "mykey";
    static const char* hubName = "Contoso";
    static const char* hubSuffix = "azure-devices.net";
    ```

6. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **remote_monitoring** project, click **Debug**, and then click **Start new instance** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.

#### Visualize your registered device and the data

7. Go back to your remote monitoring solution dashboard. You should the device has changed the status to Running on the Devices list.

    ![][18]

8. Click on the dashboard to see data coming. The sample is configured to send 50 units for internal temperature, 55 units for external temperature and 50 for humidity. Please note that the dashboard only shows temperature and humidity by default.

8. Now go to the Command and control [section](#command) to learn how to change the temperature on your device from the remote monitoring solution.


8. Now go to the Command and control section to learn how to change the temperature on your device from the remote monitoring solution.

### Running your device on mbed

The following instructions describe the steps for connecting an [mbed-enabled Freescale FRDM-K64F](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/FRDM-K64F/) device to Azure IoT Hub.


#### Requirements

- Required hardware: [mbed-enabled Freescale K64F](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/FRDM-K64F/) or similar.

#### Connect the device

- Connect the board to your network using an Ethernet cable. This step is required, as the sample depends on internet access.

- Plug the device into your computer using a micro-USB cable. Be sure to attach the cable to the correct USB port on the device, as pictured [here](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/frdm-k64f/), in the "Getting started" section.

- Follow the [instructions on the mbed handbook](https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/SerialPC) to set up the serial connection with your device from your development machine. If you are on Windows, install the Windows serial port drivers located [here](http://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration#1-download-the-mbed-windows-serial-port).

#### Create mbed project and import the sample code

- In your web browser, go to the mbed.org [developer site](https://developer.mbed.org/). If you haven't signed up, you will see an option to create a new account (it's free). Otherwise, log in with your account credentials. Then click on **Compiler** in the upper right-hand corner of the page. This should bring you to the Workspace Management interface.

- Make sure the hardware platform you're using appears in the upper right-hand corner of the window, or click the icon in the right-hand corner to select your hardware platform.

- Click **Import** on the main menu. Then click the **Click here** to import from URL link next to the mbed globe logo.

    ![][6]

- In the popup window, enter the link for the sample code https://developer.mbed.org/users/AzureIoTClient/code/remote_monitoring/

    ![][7]

- You can see in the mbed compiler that importing this project imported various libraries. Some are provided and maintained by the Azure IoT team ([azureiot_common](https://developer.mbed.org/users/AzureIoTClient/code/azureiot_common/), [iothub_client](https://developer.mbed.org/users/AzureIoTClient/code/iothub_client/), [iothub_amqp_transport](https://developer.mbed.org/users/AzureIoTClient/code/iothub_amqp_transport/), [iothub_http_transport](https://developer.mbed.org/users/AzureIoTClient/code/iothub_http_transport/), [proton-c-mbed](https://developer.mbed.org/users/AzureIoTClient/code/proton-c-mbed/)), while others are third party libraries available in the mbed libraries catalog.

    ![][8]

- Open remote_monitoring\remote_monitoring.c, locate the following code in the file:

    ```
    static const char* deviceId = "[Device Id]";
    static const char* deviceKey = "[Device Key]";
    static const char* hubName = "[IoTHub Name]";
    static const char* hubSuffix = "[IoTHub Suffix, i.e. azure-devices.net]";
    ```

3. Replace [Device Id] and [Device Key], with your device data.

4. Use the IoT Hub Hostname device data to fill in IoTHub name and IoTHub Suffix. To do this, you need to split it in to like this:

    If your IoT Hub Hostname is Contoso.azure-devices.net, Contoso will be your IoTHub name and everything after it will the the Suffix. It should look like this:

    ```
    static const char* deviceId = "mydevice";
    static const char* deviceKey = "mykey";
    static const char* hubName = "Contoso";
    static const char* hubSuffix = "azure-devices.net";
    ```

    ![][9]

#### Build and run the program

- Click **Compile** to build the program. You can safely ignore any warnings, but if the build generates errors, fix them before proceeding.

- If the build is successful, a .bin file with the name of your project is generated. Copy the .bin file to the device. Saving the .bin file to the device causes the current terminal session to the device to reset. When it reconnects, reset the terminal again manually, or start a new terminal. This enables the mbed device to reset and start executing the program.

- Connect to the device using an SSH client application, such as PuTTY. You can determine which serial port your device uses by checking the Windows Device Manager.


- In PuTTY, click the **Serial** connection type. The device most likely connects at 115200, so enter that value in the **Speed** box. Then click **Open**:

    ![][11]

The program starts executing. You may have to reset the board (press CTRL+Break or press on the board's reset button) if the program does not start automatically when you connect.

#### Visualize your registered device and the data

7. Go back to your remote monitoring solution dashboard. You should the device has changed the status to Running on the Devices list.
![][18]

8. Click on the dashboard to see data coming. The sample is configured to send 50 units for internal temperature, 55 units for external temperature and 50 for humidity. Please note that the dashboard only shows temperature and humidity by default.

8. Now go to the Command and control [section](#command) to learn how to change the temperature on your device from the remote monitoring solution.

## Sending device data to the remote monitoring solution using node.js



-   In our azure-iot-sdks repo, locate the following files: packages.json (under /node/common) and remote_monitoring.js under node/device/samples/). Copy them to your device and put them in the same folder.

- Open the remote-monitoring.js file and look for the following variables:


   ```
   var deviceID = "[DeviceID]";
   var deviceKey = "[Device Key]";
   var hubName = "[IoT Hub Name]";
   var hubSuffix = "[IoT Hub Suffix i.e azure-devices.net]";
   ```

-  Replace "[Device Id]", "[Device Key], with the data your device data.

-  Use the IoT Hub Hostname device data to fill in IoTHub name and IoTHub Suffix. To do this, you need to split it in to like this:

   If your IoT Hub Hostname is Contoso.azure-devices.net, Contoso will be your IoTHub name and everything after it will the the Suffix. It should look like this:


   ```
   var deviceID = "mydevice";
   var deviceKey = "mykey";
   var hubName = "Contoso";
   var hubSuffix = "azure-devices.net";
   ```


- Save the file. Run the following command on the destination folder:

```
npm install
node .
```

3.  Replace each of the variables with the information you gathered in the previous step. Save the changes.


4. Open a shell (Linux) or Node.js command prompt (Windows) and navigate to the **node\\samples** folder. Then run the sample application using the following command:

    ```
    node simple_sample_remotemonitoring.js
    ```

#### Visualize your device and incoming data

6. On the preconfigured solution portal, click on the devices section to ensure that the Status of your device has changed to "Running" and that you can see all the manufacturer data.

7. Click on the dashboard and select your device on "Device to View". You should now see your telemetry data being monitored on the Remote Monitoring solution.


## <a name="command"></a>Command and control your device from the dashboard

Now that your device is connected and sending self-generated temperature data from your device, you can command and control your device remotely from IoT Hub. You can implement multiple types of commands that fit your business application. In this case, we've implemented a change in temperature, as if there was a need to control it from the solution. To send the command, you should:

-  Click on your device ID on the Devices list (you can find the device section on the left side menu).

    ![][13]

- On the right menu where device details are shown, click on "Send command"


- Select the command you want to run: In this case, we choose "Set temperature", since we want to change the temperature the device is set at. Select that command and choose the temperature value. Click on Send Command and the new temperature will be pushed to the device. Note: you will see that in the command history the result of the command is "Pending". This is because, for simplicity purposes, this samples hasn't implemented any logic in the device to respond to IoT Hub. You can do this extending the solution.

    ![][14]

- Go back to the dashboard and ensure that the updated data is coming through. You should see updated statistics on temperature and the new data being displayed in the telemetry history.
